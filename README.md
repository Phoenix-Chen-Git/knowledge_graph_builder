# Copilot (Unlocked Agent Edition)

> [!NOTE]
> This is a modified fork of the [Obsidian Copilot](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot) plugin by Logan Yang. All credit for the original core architecture goes to the original author.

**Copilot (Unlocked)** is an enhanced version of the Obsidian Copilot plugin that unlocks the powerful "Agent Mode" and removes "Plus" subscription restrictions for local power users.

## 🚀 Key Differences & Features

- **🔓 Agent Mode Unlocked**: The **Autonomous Agent** capability is fully enabled for all users. The agent can:
  - Creat, edit, and delete notes in your vault.
  - Manage your files and folders.
  - Perform complex multi-step tasks.
- **🌐 Fallback Web Search**: "Online search" capability is restored using a robust local fallback (getting results from DuckDuckGo) when the official API key is missing.
- **✨ Plus Features Enabled**: All UI restrictions and "Upgrade to Plus" paywalls have been removed for a cleaner experience.
- **🧠 Local & Private**: Designed to work with your local models (via Ollama, etc.) or your own API keys without requiring a secondary subscription.

## 📦 Installation

This plugin is not available in the official Obsidian directory (due to being a fork). You can install it using **BRAT**:

1.  Install **BRAT** from the Obsidian Community Plugins list.
2.  Open **Settings > BRAT**.
3.  Click **Add Beta plugin**.
4.  Paste the URL of this repository: `https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` (Update this after you publish!)
5.  Click **Add Plugin**.

## 🛠️ Usage

1.  Open the Copilot view in Obsidian.
2.  Switch to **Agent Mode** (formerly "Plus" mode).
3.  Ask the agent to perform tasks like:
    - "Research the latest news on [topic] and create a summary note."
    - "Refactor my daily notes from last week."
    - "Find all notes about [topic] and index them."
